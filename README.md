# VIBE PLANNING Framework

**Welcome to the VIBE PLANNING framework - a comprehensive planning system designed for different uncertainty and constraint scenarios.**

> **Status**: Version 0.9 (Beta) - Framework is feature-complete and ready for testing and feedback

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

1. **Read the Framework**: Start with [`VIBE_PLANNING.md`](VIBE_PLANNING.md) for complete documentation
2. **Choose Your Template**: Use the [Template Selection Guide](templates/TEMPLATE_SELECTION_GUIDE.md) to pick the right planning approach
3. **Start Planning**: Select from our four quadrant-specific templates based on your situation

**Future Expansion:**
Additional directories will be created as the framework evolves and specific needs arise.

## 🎯 **Planning Quadrants**

The framework provides **four specialized templates** based on your planning scenario:

| Quadrant | Uncertainty | Constraints | Template | Focus |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|-------|
| **1** | Low | Low | [Optimization Template](templates/planning/quadrant_1_optimization_template.md) | Efficiency & Quality |
| **2** | High | High | [Discovery Template](templates/planning/quadrant_2_discovery_template.md) | Learning & Risk Mitigation |
| **3** | Low | High | [Constraint Template](templates/planning/quadrant_3_constraint_template.md) | Creative Solutions |
| **4** | High | Low | [Flexible Template](templates/planning/quadrant_4_flexible_template.md) | Flexibility & Options |

---

## 🔍 **How to Choose Your Template**

**Step 1: Assess Uncertainty**

- **Low**: You understand the problem and approach well
- **High**: You're exploring new territory or approaches

**Step 2: Assess Constraints**

- **Low**: Minimal resource, time, or organizational limitations
- **High**: Significant budget, timeline, or policy constraints

**Step 3: Select Template**

- Use the [Template Selection Guide](templates/TEMPLATE_SELECTION_GUIDE.md) for detailed guidance
- Choose the template that best matches your quadrant
- Customize as needed for your specific situation

---

## 📚 **Key Documents**

- **[VIBE_PLANNING.md](VIBE_PLANNING.md)**: Complete framework documentation
- **[Template Selection Guide](templates/TEMPLATE_SELECTION_GUIDE.md)**: Choose the right template
- **[Quadrant Templates](templates/planning/)**: Four specialized planning approaches

---

## 🎯 **Framework Philosophy**

**Success = Clear Goals × Viable Strategy × Executable Plan × Adequate Resources × Risk Mitigation**

The framework operates on the principle that **success is multiplicative** - all factors must be strong for maximum success probability.

---

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

1. **Understand Your Situation**: Assess uncertainty and constraint levels
2. **Choose Your Approach**: Select the appropriate quadrant template
3. **Customize Your Plan**: Adapt the template to your specific needs
4. **Execute and Adapt**: Follow the plan while remaining flexible

## 🔗 **Reference Include System**

The framework now supports **reference includes** for enhanced flexibility:

- **Embedded Artifacts**: Use templates as-is for immediate usability
- **Reference Includes**: Link external artifact templates for enhanced detail
- **Mixed Approach**: Combine both methods as needed

**Quick Reference Include Example**:

```markdown
## Resources Required
[Include: artifacts/common/resources_required.md]

## Performance Optimization
[Include: artifacts/quadrant/optimization/performance_benchmarks.md]
```

**See [REFERENCE_INCLUDE_GUIDE.md](templates/REFERENCE_INCLUDE_GUIDE.md) for complete usage instructions.**

## 📞 **Need Help?**

- **Start Here**: Read [`VIBE_PLANNING.md`](VIBE_PLANNING.md) for comprehensive guidance
- **Template Selection**: Use the [Template Selection Guide](templates/TEMPLATE_SELECTION_GUIDE.md)
- **Examples**: Check the `examples/` directory for real-world implementations

**Remember**: The right planning approach makes all the difference. Choose based on your actual situation, not what you wish it was.
