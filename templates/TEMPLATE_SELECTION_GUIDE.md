# VIBE PLANNING Template Selection Guide

**Choose the right planning template for your specific scenario**

---

## Quick Selection Matrix

| Uncertainty Level | Constraint Level | Recommended Template | Focus Area |
|------------------|------------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Low** | **Low** | **Quadrant 1: Optimization Template** | Efficiency & Quality |
| **High** | **High** | **Quadrant 2: Discovery Template** | Learning & Risk Mitigation |
| **Low** | **High** | **Quadrant 3: Constraint Template** | Creative Solutions |
| **High** | **Low** | **Quadrant 4: Flexible Template** | Flexibility & Options |

- Innovation within boundaries

---

### **Quadrant 4: Flexible Planning Template**

**Use when:**

- 🔄 You have low confidence in your approach
- 🔄 Success probability is uncertain
- 🔄 Constraints are minimal
- 🔄 Environment is dynamic and changing
- 🔄 Focus is on maintaining flexibility and options

**Best for:**

- Exploratory projects
- Research initiatives
- Innovation projects
- Market exploration
- Learning-focused initiatives

**Template characteristics:**

- Multiple scenario planning
- Option preservation strategies
- Flexible implementation approach
- Continuous learning integration
- Adaptation mechanisms

---

## Selection Decision Tree

```
Start: What is your planning scenario?

1. How confident are you in your approach?
   ├─ High Confidence → Go to Question 2
   └─ Low Confidence → Go to Question 3

2. High Confidence: What are your constraint levels?
   ├─ Low Constraints → QUADRANT 1: Optimization Template
   └─ High Constraints → QUADRANT 3: Constraint Template

3. Low Confidence: What are your constraint levels?
   ├─ High Constraints → QUADRANT 2: Discovery Template
   └─ Low Constraints → QUADRANT 4: Flexible Template
```

## Assessment Questions

### **Uncertainty Assessment**

Answer these questions to determine your uncertainty level:

- **How well do you understand the problem?**
  - Well understood = Low uncertainty
  - Partially understood = Medium uncertainty
  - Poorly understood = High uncertainty

- **How predictable is the environment?**
  - Stable and predictable = Low uncertainty
  - Somewhat predictable = Medium uncertainty
  - Dynamic and unpredictable = High uncertainty

- **How confident are you in your solution approach?**
  - Very confident = Low uncertainty
  - Somewhat confident = Medium uncertainty
  - Not confident = High uncertainty

### **Constraint Assessment**

Answer these questions to determine your constraint level:

- **What are your resource limitations?**
  - Minimal limitations = Low constraints
  - Some limitations = Medium constraints
  - Significant limitations = High constraints

- **What are your time limitations?**
  - Flexible timeline = Low constraints
  - Some time pressure = Medium constraints
  - Tight deadline = High constraints

- **What are your organizational limitations?**
  - Minimal restrictions = Low constraints
  - Some policies/processes = Medium constraints
  - Significant restrictions = High constraints

## Template Customization

### **Hybrid Scenarios**

Some planning scenarios may fall between quadrants. In these cases:

1. **Choose the closest template** based on primary characteristics
2. **Customize sections** from other templates as needed
3. **Focus on the dominant factor** (uncertainty vs. constraints)

### **Template Adaptation**

All templates can be adapted by:

- Adding relevant sections from other templates
- Modifying section content for your specific needs
- Adjusting the level of detail based on your situation

---

## Getting Started

1. **Assess your situation** using the criteria above
2. **Select the appropriate template** from the matrix
3. **Customize the template** for your specific needs
4. **Follow the template structure** to create your plan
5. **Adapt as needed** during implementation

---

## Need Help?

If you're unsure which template to use:

1. **Review the assessment questions** above
2. **Consult with stakeholders** about uncertainty and constraints
3. **Start with the most conservative template** (Quadrant 2 if uncertain)
4. **Iterate and adapt** as you learn more about your situation

---

**Remember**: The right template will make your planning more effective and efficient. Choose based on your actual situation, not what you wish it was.
